# Grafana dashboards

Some custom dashboards created for various purposes. Rather than reinventing the wheel the majority of them are based off ones I found in the Grafana market place with tweaks to make them work with my data.

- **Network Monitoring** (*Influxdb with telegraf plugins*): Monitors HTTP requests, DNS queries and ICMP (RTT, latency, packet loss)

- **Server (phone) Monitoring** *Prometheus with node-exporter* | Monitors oneplus phone running pmOS, includes battery, CPU, Memory, Disk and networking (based off dashboard 1860)
